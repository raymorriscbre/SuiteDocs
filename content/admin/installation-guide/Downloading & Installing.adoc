== Downloading and installing SuiteCRM

If you are installing SuiteCRM for the first time, follow the
instructions in this section. If you have an earlier version of SuiteCRM
installed, refer to the upgrade section for instructions on how to
upgrade your SuiteCRM instance. Follow the steps listed below to install
SuiteCRM:

.  Install the platform-appropriate (Linux or Windows) version of PHP,
web server, and database on your machine.
.  Download the SuiteCRM files from suitecrm.com(see “Downloading the
latest SuiteCRM files” section).
.  Copy the SuiteCRM files to your web server.
.  Install SuiteCRM by following the SuiteCRM installation wizard.

=== Downloading the latest SuiteCRM files

.  Navigate to the SuiteCRM Downloads section at
http://suitecrm.com/download
.  Download your flavour of SuiteCRM. We advise that all users download
the latest SuiteCRM release. The latest version will contain the latest
features and bug fixes.
.  If you experience any issues during registering an account on our
website or downloading SuiteCRM, please use our support forums.

=== Copying SuiteCRM files to web server

Once your SuiteCRM package has downloaded, you will need to unzip the
files and set permissions required for the installation process. The
following steps explain in detail the prerequisites to setting up your
SuiteCRM files for installation:

.  Locate the directory on the web server in which the SuiteCRM
directory will be located(most commonly the root directory, or within a
subdirectory).
.  Unzip SuiteCRM into the directory selected in Step 1. This creates a
“SuiteCRM” directory within your selected parent directory.
.  At this stage, you may wish to rename the default “SuiteCRM”
directory.
.  Set the correct permissions on the SuiteCRM directory (Linux):
+
[source]
----
SUITE_PATH=/var/www/html/suitecrm/
HTTP_USER=www-data
# Set classic permissions:
mkdir cache
touch .htaccess config.php
sudo chgrp -R $HTTP_USER custom/ cache/ modules/ upload/ .htaccess config.php config_override.php
sudo chmod -R g+w custom/ cache/ modules/ upload/ .htaccess config.php config_override.php

# Set SELinux context (modern Linux distributions only)
sudo restorecon -vr ./
sudo chcon -R -t httpd_sys_rw_content_t custom/ cache/ modules/ upload/ .htaccess config.php config_override.php
sudo semanage fcontext -a -t httpd_sys_rw_content_t "$SUITE_PATH(/.*)?"

After configuring SuiteCRM, you may wish to increase security by preventing certain further changes via the web:
chmod g-w .htaccess config.php config_override.php
----
.  That `www-data` needs to be replaced by the actual system user that your web server runs under. This varies depending on your
operating system. Common web server users are as follows:
..  www-data (Ubuntu Linux/Apache)
..  apache (Linux/Apache)
..  nobody (Linux/Apache)
..  IUSR_computerName (Windows/IIS)
The commands/steps taken to setting permissions differ dependant on
your operating system. If you are experiencing issues with setting
permissions on your SuiteCRM instance, visit our support forums.

=== Installing SuiteCRM

Once you have successfully copied the SuiteCRM files to your web server,
you need to install SuiteCRM by following the on-screen installation
wizard. You can navigate to the wizard by entering the following in your
web browser:

`http://<yourServer>/<yourSuiteCRMDirectory>/install.php` 

You can perform a typical installation or a custom installation. Typical
installation is recommended, but you can choose custom installation for
the following reasons: The same Database Admin User should not be used
as the SuiteCRM database administrator Locale settings should be
specified during installation instead of after logging into SuiteCRM

=== Performing a typical installation of SuiteCRM

.  Launch your browser and enter the following URL:

`http://<yourServer>/<yourSuiteCRMDirectory>/install.php`

* This displays the Welcome page.
.  Click Next.
* The Installer displays installation instructions and requirements to
help determine successful SuiteCRM installation.
.  Review the information and click Next.
* This displays the SuiteCRM License Agreement.
.  Review the license, check I Accept, and click Next. The installer
checks the system for compatibility and then displays the Installation
Options page.

clicking Install in the Confirm Setting menu. To modify any settings,
click the Back button on your browser to return to the appropriate page.
.  Select Typical Install.

name for the database. You can specify a new name. +
.. Enter the Host Name or the Host Instance for the MySQL, MariaDB or
SQL Server. The host name is, by default, set to localhost if your
database server is running on the same machine as your web server. +

.. Ensure that the Database Administrator you specify has the
permissions to create and write to the SuiteCRM database.
*  For My SQL, MariaDB and SQL Server, by default, the Installer selects
  the Admin User as the SuiteCRM Database User. The SuiteCRM application
  uses SuiteCRM Database User to communicate with the SuiteCRM database.
  You can create a different SuiteCRM Database user at this time.
*  To select an existing user, choose Provide existing user from
the SuiteCRM Database Username drop-down list. To create a new SuiteCRM
Database user, choose Define user. Enter the database username and
password in the relevant fields. Re-enter the password to confirm it.
The new user information is displayed in System Credentials on the
Confirm Settings page at the end of the installation process.
.. Accept No as the default value if you do not want the SuiteCRM Demo
data. Select Yes to populate the database with the SuiteCRM Demo data.
.  Click Next. The Installer validates the credentials of the specified
administrator. If a database with that name already exists, it displays
a dialog box asking you to either accept the database name or choose a
new database. If you use an existing database name, the database tables
will be dropped.
.  Click Accept to accept the database name or click Cancel and enter a
new name in the Database Name field.

displays a summary of the specified settings. Click Back on your browser
to navigate to previous pages if you want to change the settings.
. Click Print Summary for a printout of the settings for your records.
* Click Show Passwords and then click Print Summary to include the
database user password and the SuiteCRM admin password in the printout.

changes the button name to Hide Passwords. You can click this button to
hide the passwords again.
